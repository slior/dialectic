Design a simple in-memory cache system with the following requirements:

1. Store key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be any object
2. Support TTL (time-to-live) expiration for cache entries
3. Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy when cache reaches capacity
4. Provide thread-safe operations for concurrent access
5. Include basic metrics like hit rate and cache size

The system should be lightweight and suitable for a web application handling moderate traffic.
