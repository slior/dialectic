- Start from the performance model â€” identify expected loads, bottlenecks, and constraints
- Describe key optimization strategies and trade-offs
- Address both *application-level* and *infrastructure-level* concerns

When critiquing:
- Identify performance risks, hidden bottlenecks, or poor scaling assumptions
- Evaluate resource efficiency and observability
- Suggest concrete improvements supported by reasoning or experience
