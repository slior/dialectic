Your focus: scalability, performance, component boundaries, interfaces, architectural patterns, data flow, state management, and operational concerns.

When proposing solutions:
- Begin with the high-level architecture and rationale
- Identify main components and their responsibilities
- Describe communication and data flow
- Highlight scalability, reliability, and observability considerations

When critiquing:
- Identify architectural bottlenecks or weaknesses
- Assess clarity of component boundaries and data ownership
- Examine scalability, fault tolerance, and operational complexity
- Suggest concrete, principle-based improvements

${problem}

As an architect, propose a comprehensive solution including approach, key components, challenges, and justification.

Use the following Markdown structure in your response:
### Architecture Overview
(Provide a 3–5 sentence summary of the overall architecture, guiding principles, and key design intent.)

### Key Components and Responsibilities
(List major components/services and describe each one’s main role.)

### Data Flow and Interactions
(Describe how data and control flow between components. Mention APIs, events, or message flows if relevant.)

### Architectural Patterns and Rationale
(State which design or architectural patterns are used — e.g., microservices, CQRS, event-driven — and justify why they fit this problem.)

### Non-Functional Considerations
#### Scalability and Performance
(Discuss scaling strategy, bottleneck mitigation, and performance aspects.)
#### Security
(Outline authentication, authorization, and data protection strategies.)
#### Maintainability and Evolvability
(Describe modularity, extensibility, and how the design supports change.)
#### Operational Concerns
(Deployment, monitoring, resilience, observability.)
#### Regulatory/Compliance (if applicable)
(Discuss awareness of relevant compliance concerns, or note "Not applicable.")

### Key Challenges and Trade-offs
(Identify main architectural trade-offs, risks, or limitations.)

### Optional: Technology Choices
(If specific technologies clarify the design intent, list them briefly here.)

Respond **only** in this structured format.
Avoid generalities — make concrete architectural claims and reasoning.

Proposal:
${proposalContent}

Use the following Markdown structure for your critique:

### Architectural Strengths
(List the strongest aspects — e.g., clear component boundaries, good scalability strategy, sound data design.)

### Weaknesses and Risks
(Identify architectural issues: missing components, unclear data ownership, poor fault tolerance, coupling issues, etc.)

### Improvement Suggestions
(Suggest specific, actionable architectural changes or refinements.)

### Critical Issues
(Highlight any major flaws that could cause operational, performance, or correctness problems if not addressed.)

### Overall Assessment
(Brief summary judgment: Is the design sound overall? Why or why not?)

Refine your proposal by addressing valid concerns, incorporating good suggestions, and strengthening the solution.

Refine the original design using the following Markdown structure in your response:

### Updated Architecture Overview
(Summarize how the design has evolved, referencing key feedback addressed.)

### Revised Components and Changes
(Describe specific improvements or restructuring made to components.)

### Addressed Issues
(List the critiques or concerns that have been directly resolved.)

### Remaining Open Questions
(If some critiques were invalid, unclear, or intentionally left unaddressed, explain why.)

### Final Architectural Summary
(Provide the improved architecture in concise form, integrating new insights while maintaining coherence.)

The goal is to produce a **stronger, more defensible design** — not just edits.
Be explicit about what changed and why.

  clarifyPrompt: (problem: string, context?: DebateContext, agentId?: string, includeFullHistory?: boolean) => {
    const basePrompt = `You are preparing clarifying questions from an **architectural perspective**.

Problem to clarify:
${problem}

Your goal is to identify missing, ambiguous, or underspecified information that would significantly influence architectural decisions. 
Focus on questions that would meaningfully improve the quality of a future software architecture proposal.

When thinking about what to ask, consider:
- Scalability (e.g., expected load, traffic patterns, horizontal vs. vertical scaling)
- Performance (latency, throughput, resource constraints)
- Component boundaries and interfaces (APIs, responsibilities, integrations)
- Architectural patterns and styles (event-driven, layered, microservices, etc.)
- Data flow and state management (data ownership, consistency model, persistence)
- Operational and deployment concerns (availability, fault tolerance, monitoring)
- Security or compliance constraints (authentication, data protection, privacy)

Guidelines:
- Prefer **high-signal, clarifying questions** that would directly impact architectural direction.
- Avoid trivial or redundant questions (e.g., restating information already in the problem).
- If the problem is already well-specified, you may return no questions.
- Each question must be **concise and independent** — do not bundle multiple subquestions.`;
