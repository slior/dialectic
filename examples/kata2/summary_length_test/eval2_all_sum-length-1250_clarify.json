However, the news distribution component is barely mentioned in the architecture, appearing only as 'document sharing prioritized' without clear implementation details. The solution focuses heavily on video infrastructure but lacks specifics on how mock news sites will be integrated or managed."

However, the 10-hour event sustainability claim lacks concrete evidence - connection refresh every 3 hours may not be sufficient for maintaining quality over such duration. GPU cluster assignment strategy is sound but resource calculations (60% base + 40% emergency pool) appear arbitrary without workload analysis."

The 'simplified security framework' may be too minimal - 24-hour audit retention seems insufficient for educational accountability. The transition from 50% to 10% monitoring for new participants lacks justification. Missing details on how cross-event isolation prevents data leakage beyond container boundaries."

However, the event-centric architecture with static GPU assignment may create operational complexity when scaling beyond 10 events. The 'event affinity' approach could lead to resource fragmentation and difficult capacity planning."

            "reasoning": "Strong focus on FERPA compliance and educational privacy requirements. Addresses data sovereignty through regional deployment and provides clear consent mechanisms for recording. However, the claim of 'no specific compliance requirements' from stakeholders seems optimistic - different educational institutions likely have varying compliance needs that aren't fully addressed."

            "reasoning": "Mentions 'comprehensive load testing' in implementation phases but provides no testing strategy details. The complex hierarchical architecture with multiple tiers, regional distribution, and security boundaries would require sophisticated testing approaches that aren't specified. No discussion of how to test 10-hour event sustainability or cross-region performance degradation scenarios."
