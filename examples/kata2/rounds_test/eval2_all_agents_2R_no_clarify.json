          "reasoning": "Addresses all core requirements: video chat for diplomats, assembly speeches, news distribution, and moderation monitoring. The tiered communication approach (private negotiations, assembly broadcasting, moderation oversight) maps well to functional needs. However, the news distribution mechanism is mentioned but not architecturally detailed - unclear how mock news sites integrate with the platform."

The federated session architecture with regional coordinators handling 100-150 participants each is reasonable. However, the claim of 'linear scaling up to 1000 concurrent Mock UN sessions' lacks supporting analysis or capacity planning details."

            "reasoning": "Acknowledges educational context appropriately and implements graduated security controls. End-to-end encryption and content filtering are well-addressed. However, the threat model explicitly excludes nation-state attacks but doesn't justify why this is appropriate for a platform handling student data. The 'educational-appropriate controls' concept is mentioned but specific security measures for different event sizes lack concrete implementation details."

            "reasoning": "Emphasizes service consolidation (4 core services vs 7+) and infrastructure as code with Kubernetes orchestration. The modular architecture with clear separation of concerns supports maintainability. However, the complexity of managing regional distribution, multiple communication tiers, and graduated security controls may create operational overhead that contradicts the 'simplified' claims."

The data retention and deletion alignment with educational requirements shows awareness of regulatory needs. Strong emphasis on privacy-preserving analytics and comprehensive logging. Minor weakness: doesn't address international compliance requirements for global Mock UN events."

            "score": 5,
            "reasoning": "Mentions load testing with 'realistic diplomatic scenarios' and penetration testing in the implementation roadmap. However, lacks specific testing strategies for the complex federated architecture, graduated security controls, or the interaction between performance and security requirements. No discussion of how to test cross-regional coordination or failover scenarios."
