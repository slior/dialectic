Organization running "Mock UN" events wants to take its events online, permitting students to participate online

Requirements: student-diplomats must be able to video-chat with one another; student-diplomats must be able to "give speeches" to the "assembly" (video-chat to the entire group); (mocked) world events (created by moderators) distributed via (mock) "news sites"; moderators must be able to monitor any video chat for appropriateness

Users: 500 or so "diplomats" per "mock UN" gathering; dozens of moderators per "mock UN"; many "mock UN"s simultaneously; no new hardware requirements on students
