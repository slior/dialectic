# Publish Packages

Publish `dialectic-core` and/or `dialectic` CLI packages to npm with automatic version bumping and dependency management.

## Input Parameters

The command accepts the following parameters:

- **publish_core** (required, boolean)
  - Whether to publish the `dialectic-core` package
  - If `true`, the core package will be version-bumped, built, and published before the CLI package
  - If `false`, only the CLI package will be published (assumes core is already published)

- **core_version_bump** (optional, required if `publish_core` is `true`)
  - Version bump type for the core package
  - Must be one of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`
  - Only used when `publish_core` is `true`
  - If `publish_core` is `true` and this is not provided, default to `patch`

- **cli_version_bump** (required)
  - Version bump type for the CLI package
  - Must be one of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`
  - The CLI package will always be published with this version bump

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Parameters

1. Check that `publish_core` is provided and is a boolean (`true` or `false`)
2. Check that `cli_version_bump` is provided and is one of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`
3. If `publish_core` is `true`:
   - Check that `core_version_bump` is provided (or default to `patch` if not provided)
   - Validate `core_version_bump` is one of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`

### Step 2: Publish Core Package (if requested)

If `publish_core` is `true`:

1. **Navigate to core package directory**
   - Change to `packages/core` directory from project root
   - Use absolute paths or ensure proper directory navigation

2. **Update core version**
   - Run `npm version <core_version_bump>` (e.g., `npm version patch`)
   - This updates `packages/core/package.json` version field
   - Note: `npm version` may attempt to create a git tag, but we will create a single tag matching the CLI version later

3. **Get new core version**
   - Read the new version from `packages/core/package.json`
   - Store it in a variable for later use (e.g., `CORE_VERSION`)

4. **Build core package**
   - Run `npm run build` from `packages/core` directory
   - Or use workspace command: `npm run build:core` from project root
   - Ensure build completes successfully before proceeding

5. **Publish core package**
   - Run `npm publish --access public` from `packages/core` directory
   - Verify publish succeeds before proceeding

6. **Update CLI dependency on core**
   - Read `packages/cli/package.json`
   - Update the `dependencies` field: `"dialectic-core": "^<CORE_VERSION>"`
   - Update to match the newly published core version
   - Save the updated `package.json`

7. **Commit core version changes (no tag yet)**
   - From project root, stage the version changes:
     - `packages/core/package.json`
     - `packages/cli/package.json` (if dependency was updated)
     - `package-lock.json` (if it was modified)
   - Commit with message: `"chore: bump dialectic-core to <CORE_VERSION> and update CLI dependency"`
   - **Note**: Do not create a git tag here. A single tag matching the CLI version will be created after all commits are done.

### Step 3: Build CLI Package

1. **Build CLI package**
   - From project root, run `npm run build:cli`
   - Or navigate to `packages/cli` and run `npm run build`
   - Ensure build completes successfully
   - This ensures the CLI package is built with the latest core dependency

### Step 4: Publish CLI Package

1. **Invoke publish script**
   - Execute `scripts/publish-cli.sh` with `cli_version_bump` as argument
   - Use absolute path or ensure script is executable
   - The script will:
     - Update CLI version using `npm version <cli_version_bump>`
     - Build the CLI package
     - Publish to npm with `--access public`
   - Note: The script runs `npm version` which may create a git tag, but if the working directory isn't clean, it won't

2. **Commit CLI version changes (if needed)**
   - Check if `packages/cli/package.json` has uncommitted changes
   - If changes exist:
     - Read the new CLI version from `packages/cli/package.json`
     - From project root, stage the version changes:
       - `packages/cli/package.json`
       - `package-lock.json` (if it was modified)
     - Commit with message: `"chore: bump dialectic CLI to <CLI_VERSION>"`

3. **Create single git tag matching CLI version**
   - Read the final CLI version from `packages/cli/package.json`
   - From project root, create annotated git tag: `git tag -a "v<CLI_VERSION>" -m "Release dialectic@<CLI_VERSION>"`
   - Verify tag was created: `git tag --list | grep "v<CLI_VERSION>"`
   - **Note**: This is the only git tag created, matching the CLI package version

4. **Verify success**
   - Check that the script exits with success code
   - Display the published version to the user

## Implementation Instructions

When executing this command, follow these steps precisely:

1. **Parameter Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Validate publish_core is boolean
   if (publish_core !== true && publish_core !== false) {
     throw new Error("publish_core must be true or false");
   }
   
   // Validate cli_version_bump
   if (!['major', 'minor', 'patch'].includes(cli_version_bump)) {
     throw new Error("cli_version_bump must be 'major', 'minor', or 'patch'");
   }
   
   // If publishing core, validate core_version_bump
   if (publish_core && !core_version_bump) {
     core_version_bump = 'patch'; // Default to patch
   }
   if (publish_core && !['major', 'minor', 'patch'].includes(core_version_bump)) {
     throw new Error("core_version_bump must be 'major', 'minor', or 'patch'");
   }
   ```

2. **Publish Core (if requested)**
   - Navigate to `packages/core` directory
   - Run: `npm version <core_version_bump>`
   - Read new version from `packages/core/package.json`: `require('./packages/core/package.json').version`
   - Run: `npm run build` (from core directory) or `npm run build:core` (from root)
   - Run: `npm publish --access public` (from core directory)
   - Update `packages/cli/package.json`:
     - Read the file
     - Update `dependencies["dialectic-core"]` to `"^<new_core_version>"`
     - Write the file back
   - **Commit core version changes (no tag yet):**
     - From project root, stage: `packages/core/package.json`, `packages/cli/package.json`, `package-lock.json`
     - Commit: `git commit -m "chore: bump dialectic-core to <new_core_version> and update CLI dependency"`
     - **Note**: Do not create a tag here. A single tag matching the CLI version will be created after all commits are done.

3. **Build CLI**
   - From project root, run: `npm run build:cli`
   - Or from CLI directory: `npm run build`

4. **Publish CLI**
   - Execute: `bash scripts/publish-cli.sh <cli_version_bump>`
   - Or: `./scripts/publish-cli.sh <cli_version_bump>` (if executable)
   - Use absolute path resolution if needed
   - Ensure script has proper permissions
   - **After script completes, commit CLI version changes (if needed):**
     - Check if `packages/cli/package.json` has uncommitted changes
     - If changes exist:
       - Read new CLI version from `packages/cli/package.json`
       - From project root, stage: `packages/cli/package.json`, `package-lock.json`
       - Commit: `git commit -m "chore: bump dialectic CLI to <new_cli_version>"`
   - **Create single git tag matching CLI version:**
     - Read final CLI version from `packages/cli/package.json`
     - From project root, create tag: `git tag -a "v<new_cli_version>" -m "Release dialectic@<new_cli_version>"`
     - Verify: `git tag --list | grep "v<new_cli_version>"`
     - **Note**: This is the only git tag created, matching the CLI package version

## Error Handling

- If any step fails, stop execution and report the error
- Provide clear error messages indicating which step failed
- Do not proceed to next step if previous step failed
- Validate npm authentication before attempting to publish (check `npm whoami`)

## Path Handling

- All paths should be relative to project root or use absolute paths
- Script should work from any directory (use path resolution)
- Handle Windows compatibility (Git Bash/WSL paths)

## Output

Provide clear output at each step:
- "Publishing dialectic-core with <version_bump> bump..."
- "Building dialectic-core..."
- "Published dialectic-core@<version>"
- "Updating CLI dependency on dialectic-core to ^<version>..."
- "Committing core version changes..."
- "Building CLI package..."
- "Publishing dialectic CLI with <version_bump> bump..."
- "Committing CLI version changes..."
- "Creating git tag v<cli_version> (matching CLI package version)..."
- "Published dialectic@<version>"

## Example Usage

**Publish both core and CLI:**
```
Publish packages with:
- publish_core: true
- core_version_bump: patch
- cli_version_bump: patch
```

**Publish only CLI (core already published):**
```
Publish packages with:
- publish_core: false
- cli_version_bump: minor
```

**Publish core with major bump, CLI with patch:**
```
Publish packages with:
- publish_core: true
- core_version_bump: major
- cli_version_bump: patch
```

## Dependencies

- npm must be authenticated (`npm login` or `npm whoami` should succeed)
- Git repository (for `npm version` to create tags)
- All dependencies installed (`npm install` completed)
- Build tools available (TypeScript compiler)

## Notes

- The `npm version` command may create git tags automatically, but only if the working directory is clean
- **Important**: This command explicitly commits version changes and creates a **single git tag** matching the CLI package version after all commits are done
- **Tag Strategy**: Only one git tag is created per release, matching the CLI package version (e.g., `v0.5.2`). This tag is created after all version commits are complete, regardless of whether core was also published
- The CLI package depends on `dialectic-core`, so core must be published first if it changed
- Version bumps follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- The publish script (`scripts/publish-cli.sh`) handles CLI-specific publishing logic
- The git tag is created as an annotated tag with a descriptive message for better version tracking
